# Spotify-Search
This project demonstrates how to integrate with the Spotify Web API to search for artists and retrieve their top tracks using the Client Credentials Flow for authentication. The code is organized into functions that perform specific tasks, from obtaining an access token to fetching artist details and their top songs.
